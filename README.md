# cnhasm - Assembler Only

This is a pretty jank assembler for a custom 16-bit architecture my group designed in a computer architecture course. However, the original repository containing all of the architecure details, Verilog implementation, and design journals are in a private GitHub repository. This is the only piece of the project I am willing to publicly release as this is mostly my work with some amends made by my group members.

***NOTE***: You can use this code as an example, but be sure to properly credit it to prevent plagarism!
